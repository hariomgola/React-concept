/**
 # React Components
  - React is JavaScript library to building user interfaces
  - react and react-dom both library combine to make a working react
  - All userinterfaces in react are made up of component.

 # Component
  - Reusability(Don't repeat yourself)  and  separation of concerns(helps in small and managable code)
  - Split big chrunks of code into multiple smaller functions.

 # Component Build
  - HTML    CSS     JavaScript
  - React allows you to create re-usable and reactive components consisting of HTML and JavaScript (and css)
  - React uses a declarative approach.
  - Define the desired target state and let react figure out the actual javascript DOM instructions.
